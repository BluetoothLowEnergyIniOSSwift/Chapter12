# Bluetooth Low Energy in iOS Swift

## Chapter 12: Project: Echo Client and Server


These are **complete downloadable code examples** from my book, _Bluetooth Low Energy with iOS Swift_.  The book teaches how to make Bluetooth Low Energy devices using iOS/Swift.  

This chapter teaches:
* Central: Create an Echo Client that connects to a Peripheral, sends text, receive and display echoed text back.
* Peripheral: Create an Echo Server that receives text and responds with the same text to the connected Client.
